GMod Civilizations: Rebooted Gamemode

This is a game mode for Garry's Mod that existed back in 2011-2012 created by Matt and Omen.
With the GMod 13 update it became broken. 

I have fixed some of the issues with it, but I am not a master coder, so if you can fix something, submit a pull request.

I have so far replaced the datastream and GLON code with the Net library, but I am unsure if it worked.

The login SQL menu works.

Things that do not work:
The backpack is always blank - unknown how to fix currently.
The building menu is always blank - ditto.

Please submit pull requests if you fix any bugs as it will help everyone who clones this repo.
